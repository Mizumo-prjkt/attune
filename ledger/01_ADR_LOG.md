# 01 — Architecture Decision Records (ADR Log)

This file records all major architectural decisions for **Attune**, including context, considered alternatives, and rationale. Future AI sessions must respect `LOCKED` decisions unless explicitly instructed by the user to revise them.

## ADR-001: Algorithm-First, Headless-First Development Order
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**: Building a music player UI in Flutter before proving the transition/mixing algorithm leads to wasted UI rework and slow iteration cycles when testing DSP math.
- **Decision**: We will build and validate the **Audio Analysis & Transition Engine** as a standalone headless library and CLI (`attune-core` + `attune-cli`) first. The Flutter UI skeleton will only be built after the transition algorithm is verified on real benchmark songs.
- **Consequences**:
  - Rapid CLI-based iteration (render transition windows directly to `.wav` and inspect `.tap`/`.ptr` JSON/binary dumps).
  - The headless CLI naturally doubles as our **External Compute Node** daemon for processing audio on a desktop/server!

## ADR-002: Hybrid Rust Core + C/C++ DSP Primitives with Flutter UI
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**:
  - Flutter/Dart cannot execute real-time, lock-free sample-accurate dual-deck audio mixing, formant-preserving pitch shifting, or phase-locked time-stretching on its own.
  - We evaluated Pure C++20 vs. Pure Rust vs. a Hybrid Rust + C/C++ DSP architecture.
- **Decision**:
  - **Frontend**: Flutter (Cross-platform UI, state visualization, library browsing).
  - **Core Engine & Orchestration (`attune-core`)**: **Rust** bridged to Flutter via `flutter_rust_bridge` v2. Rust manages the dual-deck playback state machine, thread-safe ring buffers, background worker queues, SQLite/binary cache ledger, and External Compute Node LAN/HTTP synchronization.
  - **DSP & Audio I/O Primitives**: Statically linked C/C++ battle-tested libraries inside Rust where pure Rust equivalents are less mature—specifically `Signalsmith Stretch` (or `RubberBand`) for formant-preserving pitch/time shifting, `miniaudio` for glitch-free cross-platform audio callback I/O, and `ONNX Runtime` / `tract` for lightweight quantized instrument/vibe neural heads.
- **Consequences**:
  - Memory safety and fearless concurrency for background/on-demand analysis threads.
  - Zero-boilerplate FFI generation between Flutter and native code.
  - Best-in-class vocal pitch/formant preservation from C++ DSP libraries.

## ADR-003: Three-Tier Compute & Portable Content-Addressable Cache
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**: Full-track multi-layer audio profiling (especially neural instrument tagging, pitch tracking, and optional stem separation) can be CPU/battery-intensive on lower-end mobile devices. However, users still want instant transitions when picking songs on the fly.
- **Decision**:
  1. Separate **Analysis/Planning** (produces `.tap` Track Analysis Profiles and `.ptr` Pairwise Transition Recipes) from **Real-Time Playback** (consumes `.ptr` automation keyframes with minimal CPU).
  2. Support three execution modes sharing the exact same cache format:
     - **Mode 1 — On-Demand JIT Fast-Pass**: Decodes and analyzes only the **last 45s of Track A** and **first 45s of Track B** when an unanalyzed song is queued next.
     - **Mode 2 — Local Background Idle Worker**: Processes full tracks at low OS thread priority when idle/charging.
     - **Mode 3 — External Compute Node**: Runs on an external PC, NAS, or cloud server to process libraries (with deeper ML models) and syncs the `.tap`/`.ptr` reference cache to the playback device.
  3. Key all cache entries by a **Content-Addressable Acoustic Hash** (rather than local file paths) so caches generated on an external PC work immediately on a phone.

## ADR-004: Five-Layer Audio Profiling with Hybrid DSP + Ultra-Light Quantized Audio Tagging
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**:
  - Two songs can share the same BPM and key yet fail miserably in a transition if their vocal phrasing, instrument texture, or rhythmic aggression clash.
  - Conversely, two songs with very different global metadata can transition iconically if their local audio profiles align—for example:
    - **Vocal Sustain Match**: *Whitney Houston ("I Will Always Love You")* $\rightarrow$ *Mariah Carey ("All I Want For Christmas Is You")* via a held *"youuuuu"* pitch/formant bridge.
    - **Instrument & Vibe Match**: An *Ado* track transitioning into a punk or J-Rock track that shares overdriven guitar presence, vocal grit (*ganari*), or aggressive snare transients.
    - **Genre Energy Differentiation**: Knowing whether a track segment is **Aggressive Rock/Punk**, **Slow Rock**, or **Pop** so we don't apply a slow 12-second dreamy crossfade to high-octane punk tracks (which creates muddy distortion clashes) or slam a hard punk cut onto a soft ballad without a proper breakdown/reverb bridge.
- **Decision**:
  - Extract **Five Layers** per Cue Zone:
    1. Micro-Pitch & Sustained Formant Contour ($f_0, F_1, F_2$)
    2. Local Harmonic Chroma (12-bin CQT)
    3. Dynamic Rhythm, Beat & Phrase Grid
    4. 4-Band Spectral Energy Envelopes
    5. **Instrument Signature, Vibe & Genre-Aggression Layer**: Uses a **Hybrid DSP + Ultra-Light Quantized Audio Tagging Model** (~2–4 MB quantized ONNX/TFLite model like MobileNetV3-Audio/EffNet on mobile devices, paired with a deeper model on the External Compute Node) plus mathematical DSP descriptors (attack slope, spectral roughness, sub-beat onset density) to output Active Instrument Tags, Vocal Grit Detection, Aggression Index $\mathcal{A} \in [0, 1]$, and Groove Family Vectors.

## ADR-005: External Node Metadata Cache + Optional Pre-Rendered Stem Bridges
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**: Sometimes a transition between two complex tracks (such as isolating Whitney Houston's held vocal while removing her backing band, or isolating an incoming punk drum fill / guitar riff on an Ado transition) is dramatically cleaner with 4-stem source separation (Demucs), which is too heavy to run in real time on low-end mobile phones.
- **Decision**:
  - By default, the External Compute Node exports lightweight `.tap` and `.ptr` metadata caches (~15–30 KB per track).
  - Additionally, for high-value "hero" transitions (`ARCHETYPE_1_SUSTAIN_BRIDGE` and `ARCHETYPE_2_RIFF_HANDOFF`) where background instrumentation would otherwise clash, the External Compute Node can **optionally pre-render a short 5–8 second isolated vocal/instrument stem bridge snippet** (via Demucs/HTDemucs) and attach its URI (`optional_stem_bridge_uri`) to the `.ptr` recipe for effortless playback on weaker devices.

## ADR-006: Pure Rust Audio Ingestion, RealFFT Spectral Frame Pipeline & Headless CLI Harness
- **Date**: 2026-10-27
- **Status**: `LOCKED`
- **Context**: In Phase 1, we require a cross-platform, zero-system-dependency headless audio decoder, 5-layer feature extractor, and WAV transition renderer capable of running on any desktop OS, CI runner, or headless container without requiring external FFmpeg shared libraries or complex toolchains.
- **Decision**:
  - Use `symphonia` (v0.5.x) as the pure Rust media format probing and decoding engine, supporting WAV, MP3, FLAC, AAC, OGG, and ALAC.
  - Use `realfft` (v3.5) for real-to-complex forward Fourier transforms on 2048-point Hann-windowed frames at 20 Hz (50 ms hop size).
  - Use `hound` (v3.5) for deterministic, lossless 16-bit PCM WAV rendering of transition recipes.
  - Implement the `attune-cli` binary with `clap` (v4.5) providing `analyze`, `plan`, `render`, `transition`, and `benchmarks` subcommands.
- **Consequences**:
  - The entire DSP analysis and transition planning engine builds and tests headlessly with `cargo test` in seconds.
  - All 4 benchmark transitions are fully automated and reproducible without external runtime audio daemon dependencies.
